<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Antonio Paulo! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„</h1>

I'm a developer who always likes tackling new projects and studying computer science stuff! I'm a Computer Science student in college. :)

I enjoy diving into different fields, from creating web applications to building games and even working with embedded systems from time to time. 

I believe there's always new things to discover, it's important to always be open to learning.
